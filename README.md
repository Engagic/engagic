what it is right now: llm summary of city council packets, we can turn several hundred pages of process into a couple paragraphs with clear details on things like budget amounts, location specifics


things i'd like to include short term are: record of council member voting patterns, heavy increase in city coverage (basically none right now, building the infra first), being able to set a flag for certain topics to be notified when they come up + insta send a prewritten email with your opinion to be included in public comments. polis


Free, no tracking beyond request metrics to gauge interest, no ads. Just making information accessible to those for whom it matters
