what it is right now: llm summary of city council packets, we can turn 250+ pages into a couple paragraphs with clear details on things like budget amounts, location specifics


things i'd like to include short term are: record of council member voting patterns, heavy increase in city coverage (basically none right now, building the infra first), being able to set a flag for certain topics to be notified when they come up + insta send a prewritten email with your opinion to be included in public comments


Free, no tracking, no ads. Just making information accessible to those for who it matters
