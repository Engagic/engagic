['The item is a proposed local law (Int. No. 214) aiming to amend the New York City administrative code.', 'The core purpose is to establish a private right of action for individuals unlawfully detained based on civil immigration detainers.', 'It specifically targets sections related to the Department of Correction (9-131), Police Department (14-154), and Department of Social Services (9-205) by removing previous prohibitions on private lawsuits.', 'Key changes include allowing individuals or their direct relatives to sue for unlawful detention, seeking damages (including punitive), and declaratory/injunctive relief.', 'The bill explicitly states that courts may award litigation costs to the prevailing party and that this right does not limit other common law or statutory causes of action.', 'Sponsors are Council Members Hanif, Krishnan, Rivera, Powers, Restler, and Avilés.', 'The effective date is 60 days after the law is enacted.', 'No specific fiscal impact statement for this particular bill was found in the provided documents, which is a notable absence for a complex item.']

## Summary

Local Law Int. No. 214 proposes a significant amendment to the administrative code of the City of New York, creating a **private right of action** related to civil immigration detainers and cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This means that individuals who believe they have been unlawfully detained by city agencies, such as the Police Department (NYPD) or Department of Correction (DOC), based on civil immigration detainers, or their direct relatives, will be able to sue the city. The law specifically modifies existing administrative code sections (e.g., 9-131, 14-154, and 9-205) by removing language that previously prevented such private lawsuits. Successful actions could result in various forms of relief, including **damages (potentially punitive)**, as well as **declaratory and injunctive relief**, with courts authorized to award litigation costs to the prevailing party. The bill, sponsored by Council Members Hanif, Krishnan, Rivera, Powers, Restler, and Avilés, is set to take effect **60 days** after it becomes law. No specific fiscal impact statement for this bill was included in the provided agenda documents.

## Citizen Impact

This law will **significantly empower** individuals and their families who believe they have been unlawfully detained by NYC agencies due to civil immigration detainers. It creates a direct legal avenue for **financial compensation and injunctive relief** against the city, increasing accountability for city agencies involved in immigration enforcement. The changes will become effective **60 days** after the law is enacted.

The City of Palo Alto's Planning and Development Services has completed a feasibility study on marketing housing without on-site parking, as required by the 2023-2031 Housing Element Program 3.9(B). Due to State law (AB 2097), which eliminates minimum parking requirements near transit stations, the City cannot legally impose or collect in-lieu parking fees in these areas. Consequently, staff does not recommend amending the Municipal Code to expand the in-lieu parking program to residential projects at this time.

Approval of a Record of Land Use Action to Reclassify the Historic Building Located at 1680 Bryant Street From a Category 2 Resource on the Local Historic Inventory to a Category 3 Resource.	## Summary

The City Council will consider reclassifying the historic building at **1680 Bryant Street** from a **Category 2** to a **Category 3** resource on the local Historic Resources Inventory on **December 15, 2025**. This **1914 Prairie-style residence**, designed by **John Hudson Thomas**, was originally part of a larger dual-family home. Staff and consultant **Page & Turnbull** recommend the downgrade because the property no longer meets Category 2 criteria due to the **1946 demolition** of a connecting wing and the **1997 demolition** of its other half at 275 Lowell Avenue. The **Historic Resources Board (HRB)**, however, recommended retaining the Category 2 status, citing concerns about losing historic protections like demolition delay requirements.

## Citizen Impact

This reclassification will reduce the level of historic preservation protections for the property at **1680 Bryant Street**, potentially affecting future development or demolition decisions for this notable building.

The City Council is set to adopt a resolution approving and attesting to the accuracy of the City's 2024 Power Source Disclosure (PSD) and Power Content Label (PCL) reports. This action allows the City to be exempt from a third-party audit requirement for its electricity suppliers, as mandated by Senate Bill 1305. The reports detail the sources of energy used to provide electricity to customers, including the standard carbon-neutral product and the voluntary PaloAltoGreen product. Notably, the City sold a significant amount of in-state renewable generation in 2024, using the revenue to fund local decarbonization initiatives. The share of eligible renewables on the reports was lower in 2024 (38%) compared to previous years due to the sale of renewable energy and the CEC's categorization of out-of-state power as 'unspecified power,' though the overall power supply remained carbon-neutral.

## Citizen Impact

Residents will receive updated information on the sources of their electricity through the Power Content Label, ensuring transparency in the city's energy mix and carbon neutrality efforts.

Projections indicate an average of **$1.9 million per year** in net revenue over the next five years (2026-2030), though this is expected to decline due to increasing state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements and city load growth. The Utilities Advisory Commission unanimously recommended reaffirmation.

## Citizen Impact

This action will **continue to fund local decarbonization programs** and potentially offset electric operational costs, with no direct new costs to residents.

This report details the financial status and project updates for San José's park and recreation infrastructure, covering Fiscal Year 2024-2025. The **Park Impact Ordinance (PIO)** and **Parkland Dedication Ordinance (PDO)**, authorized by the Mitigation Fee Act (Chapter 14.25) and Quimby Act (Chapter 19.38) respectively, collected **$4.9 million** in in-lieu fees, contributing to a Park Trust Fund ending balance of **$100.4 million**. These fees, along with other revenues, funded **$12.4 million** in expenditures for park improvements, with major collections in Council Districts 3 and 4. The report highlights **$77.4 million** in Construction and Conveyance Tax allocations, including **$51.2 million** for project-specific capital and **$8.6 million** for ongoing maintenance needs.

Significant grant funding was secured, including **$4.7 million** for all-inclusive playgrounds, **$6.6 million** for the Coyote Creek Trail (Mabury to Empire Street), and **$4.5 million** for the future Brickyard Park. The **Measure P Bond Projects Fund** has an ending balance of **$18.3 million**, with the **$22.7 million** Columbus Park Soccer Facility being the last major project, slated for a Winter 2026 start and Q4 2027 completion. The 2017 Coyote Creek Flood Recovery efforts show a projected total expense of **$28.7 million**, with the City's share increasing by **$7.1 million** to **$15.7 million** due to lower-than-expected FEMA/CalOES reimbursements.

The San José City Council is considering amendments to **Title 19 (Subdivisions)** and **Title 20 (Zoning Code)** of the Municipal Code, primarily to align with new state laws and streamline housing development regulations. This comprehensive update, identified as Planning File No. PP25-001, aims to facilitate housing production and improve permitting efficiency across the city.

## Key Housing Development Changes
*   **SB 9 Implementation:** Revisions to Senate Bill 9 standards for two-unit developments and urban lot splits in R-1 (Single-Family) zones include flexible driveway easements (4-7 feet or 12-15 feet, depending on street width), an increased maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) to **0.65** (from 0.45), and new lot coverage standards (e.g., **0.75** for 1,200-2,500 sq ft lots, **0.65** for 2,501-9,000 sq ft, **0.60** for >9,000 sq ft). Height limits for two-story units near rear property lines are adjusted to **25 feet** (from 20 feet) within **15 feet** (from 20 feet) of the line. The ordinance also extends SB 9-type ministerial approval to **R-2 (Two-Family) Zoning Districts** and allows such development on historic properties of lesser significance, subject to objective design standards.
*   **Small Lot Subdivisions (SB 684 & SB 1123):** Incorporates state laws for ministerial approval of up to **10 new lots and 10 housing units** in multi-family and single-family zones, with a minimum density of **19.8 dwelling units per acre** (if lower than 66% of maximum allowable). Minimum lot sizes are set at **1,200 sq ft** for single-family and **600 sq ft** for multi-family, with an average unit size cap of **1,750 sq ft**.
*   **Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs):** Updates align with SB 1211, allowing up to **8 detached ADUs** on existing multi-family properties (not exceeding existing units) and **2 detached ADUs** on new multi-family developments. It also streamlines ADU condominium conversions.
*   **Group Homes:** New definitions and regulations ensure group homes are treated as single-family dwellings for zoning purposes, consistent with the City's Housing Element.

## Other Streamlining & Updates
*   **Heat Pumps:** Allows heat pumps to encroach up to **2 feet** into setback areas (maintaining a minimum **3-foot** side setback) in various zoning districts.
*   **Hydrogen Fuel Cell Stations:** Streamlines permitting for these stations (SB 1418) in commercial and industrial zones.
*   **Secondhand Stores:** Removes the Special Use Permit requirement for general secondhand stores in Downtown (AB 2632).
*   **Density Bonuses & Ministerial Approvals:** Chapters 20.190 and 20.195 are streamlined for readability and compliance with state laws.
*   **Special Use Permits:** Allows for amendments to existing Special Use Permits, reducing the need for new applications for minor project modifications.

This ordinance was recommended for approval by the Planning Commission with a 9-0-1 vote on November 19, 2025, and an Addendum to the prior Environmental Impact Reports (Planning File No. ER25-220) found no new significant environmental impacts. The ordinance is scheduled for City Council consideration on December 16, 2025, and will become effective **30 days** after its second reading.

## Citizen Impact

These changes will significantly **increase housing options** by streamlining the approval process for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), duplexes, and small-scale multi-unit developments in many neighborhoods, potentially contributing to a more diverse and affordable housing supply. Residents will also benefit from **faster permitting** for home improvements like heat pump installations and clearer rules for development on historic properties. New construction projects will operate under standardized hours (7 AM - 7 PM Mon-Fri near residential) and include environmental awareness training, aiming to **reduce neighborhood disruption**.
