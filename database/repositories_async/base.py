"""Base repository with async PostgreSQL connection pooling

All repositories inherit from BaseRepository and share:
- Connection pool (no connection per-instance)
- Transaction context managers
- Query execution helpers with proper error handling
- Logging infrastructure

Return Type Conventions
-----------------------
All repository methods follow these patterns for consistency:

    get_X(id) -> Optional[T]
        Single entity lookup by primary key.
        Returns None if entity not found.

    get_Xs(...) -> List[T]
        Multiple entity retrieval with filters.
        Returns empty list [] if none match.

    get_X_batch(ids) -> Dict[str, T]
        Batch lookup by multiple IDs.
        Returns dict mapping found IDs to entities.
        Missing IDs are absent from dict (not errors).
        Use .get(id) to handle missing keys gracefully.

Connection Patterns
-------------------
    self.pool.acquire()
        Use for read-only queries that don't need atomicity.

    self.transaction()
        Use for writes or multi-statement reads needing consistency.

    Design Principles:
    - Pool is passed in, not created (singleton pattern)
    - Transactions are explicit (async with self.transaction())
    - Queries use $1, $2 placeholders (PostgreSQL parameterization)
    - All methods are async (no sync fallbacks)
