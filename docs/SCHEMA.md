## Overview

### Database Philosophy

**Single Source of Truth:** One unified PostgreSQL database for all civic data.

**Matters-First Architecture:** Legislative items tracked across meetings with deduplication. Council members and committees tracked for accountability.

**Hybrid Normalization Strategy:** Topics normalized for efficient querying, complex structures (attachments, sponsors) stored as JSONB for flexibility.

**Foreign Keys Enforced:** Referential integrity with CASCADE deletes.

**Connection Pooling:** asyncpg connection pool (5-20 connections) for true concurrent read/write operations.

---

## Design Decisions

### JSONB vs Normalization Strategy

Engagic uses a **hybrid approach** balancing query performance and schema flexibility:

#### Normalized Tables (Separate Tables)

**When to normalize:**
- Fields queried in WHERE clauses (filtering)
- Aggregation queries (COUNT, GROUP BY)
- Simple one-to-many relationships

**Topics (3 normalized tables):**
- `meeting_topics` (meeting_id, topic) - PRIMARY KEY (meeting_id, topic)
- `item_topics` (item_id, topic) - PRIMARY KEY (item_id, topic)
- `matter_topics` (matter_id, topic) - PRIMARY KEY (matter_id, topic)

**Why normalized:**
- Fast filtering: `SELECT * FROM meetings WHERE id IN (SELECT meeting_id FROM meeting_topics WHERE topic = 'Housing')`
- Efficient aggregation: `SELECT topic, COUNT(*) FROM meeting_topics GROUP BY topic`
- GIN indexes on topic columns for full-text search

**Zipcodes (many-to-many):**
- `zipcodes` (banana, zipcode, is_primary) - PRIMARY KEY (banana, zipcode)

**Why normalized:**
- Search by zipcode (user feature)
- Many-to-many relationship (cities have multiple zipcodes)

#### JSONB Fields (Not Normalized)

**When to use JSONB:**
- Complex nested structures (objects within arrays)
- Variable schemas (metadata varies by vendor)
- Rarely queried fields (displayed but not filtered)

**Attachments (JSONB in 2 tables):**
- `items.attachments` - JSONB array: `[{url, title, pages}]`
- `city_matters.attachments` - JSONB array

**Why JSONB:**
- Complex structure: Each attachment has 3 fields (url, title, pages)
- Display-only: Shown to users but rarely filtered
- No query pattern: "Show all items with PDF attachment" not a current requirement

**Sponsors (JSONB):**
- `city_matters.sponsors` - JSONB array: `["Council Member Smith", "Mayor Jones"]`

**Why JSONB:**
- Simple array of strings
- Display-only: Listed on meeting pages
- Actual sponsorship relationships tracked in `sponsorships` table for queries

**Participation (JSONB):**
- `meetings.participation` - JSONB object: `{email, phone, zoom}`

**Why JSONB:**
- Semi-structured data (3 optional fields)
- Display-only: Contact info shown to users
- No filtering: Never queried, just displayed

**Metadata (JSONB):**
- `city_matters.metadata` - Vendor-specific data
- `council_members.metadata` - Additional member info

**Why JSONB:**
- Intentionally flexible (varies by vendor)
- Not queried (internal debugging/diagnostics)

## Querying Examples

### Get all votes by a council member
```sql
SELECT v.*, cm.title as matter_title, m.date as vote_date
FROM votes v
JOIN city_matters cm ON v.matter_id = cm.id
JOIN meetings m ON v.meeting_id = m.id
WHERE v.council_member_id = 'nashvilleTN_abc123'
ORDER BY m.date DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Get committee roster
```sql
SELECT c.name as member_name, c.title, cm.role
FROM committee_members cm
JOIN council_members c ON cm.council_member_id = c.id
WHERE cm.committee_id = 'sanfranciscoCA_planning'
  AND cm.left_at IS NULL
ORDER BY cm.role DESC, c.name;
```

### Get matter voting history
```sql
SELECT
  m.date,
  ma.committee,
  ma.vote_outcome,
  ma.vote_tally
FROM matter_appearances ma
JOIN meetings m ON ma.meeting_id = m.id
WHERE ma.matter_id = 'nashvilleTN_BL2025-001'
ORDER BY ma.appeared_at;
```

### Find meetings by topic
```sql
SELECT m.*
FROM meetings m
JOIN meeting_topics mt ON m.id = mt.meeting_id
WHERE mt.topic = 'housing'
ORDER BY m.date DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

# Restore
psql -U engagic -d engagic < /root/backups/engagic_20251201.sql
```

### Statistics

```sql
-- Table row counts
SELECT
  'cities' as table_name, COUNT(*) as rows FROM cities
UNION ALL SELECT 'meetings', COUNT(*) FROM meetings
UNION ALL SELECT 'items', COUNT(*) FROM items
UNION ALL SELECT 'city_matters', COUNT(*) FROM city_matters
UNION ALL SELECT 'council_members', COUNT(*) FROM council_members
UNION ALL SELECT 'committees', COUNT(*) FROM committees
